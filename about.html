  <h2>About</h2>
  <p><em>Billingual Multimedia journalist</em></p>
  <p> I was born and raised in Venezuela, a country which is currently suffering a political, economic and social crisis.
    Due to the unbearable situation, I decided to come to the United States in search of better opportunities.</p>
  <p>Growing up in such a conflicted country, I developed a passion for politics and communications. Being the voice of those who are not able to express themselves is what motivates me.
     For me, showing the world what is really happening feels as a responsibility.
     That is why I chose to study journalism. I want to be heard, I want to create content, I want to inform the public.</p>
  <p>Aspiring to be a journalist in the international political field, I will continue developing opportunities to further reach my goals.</p>
